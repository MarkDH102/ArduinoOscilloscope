# Arduino Oscilloscope

Simple 6 channel 'scope for Arduino

Use an Arduino UNO board with a 16MHz ATMEGA 328P for best performance.

I can achieve a maximum sample rate of approx 76kHz across all 6 channles so can measure 5kHz signals. Not much, but can be useful...

Compile the VB.NET code to a RELEASE EXE and run outside of the Visual Studio environment to get the best performance.
